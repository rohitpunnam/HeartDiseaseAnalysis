Heart Disease Prediction & Patient Risk Analytics Dashboard

This repository contains the full Power BI case study, documentation, and files for the Heart Disease Analytics Dashboard, developed using Power BI to analyze patient health indicators and identify heart disease risk factors.

Case Study Overview:
The project analyzes key medical attributes such as:
1. Age
2. Cholesterol
3. Chest Pain Type
4. Max Heart Rate (Thalach)
5. Gender
6. Exercise-induced pain
7. Heart disease status (target)
The purpose of this project is to help healthcare professionals understand patient risk levels and support preventive decision-making through an interactive analytical dashboard

Files Included:
Heart_Disease_Stories.pdf   - Contains Stories 1 & 2 required for the final submission.
Heart_Disease_Stories.docx  - Word version of Story 1 & Story 2.
heart_diseases_bi.pbix	    - Power BI dashboard file.
dataset.xlsx / dataset.csv  -	Source dataset imported into Power BI.
dashboard_screenshot.png	  - Screenshot of the main dashboard.
README.md	Documentation     - file describing the project

Dashboard Features:
The Heart Disease Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive visual overview of key patient health indicators using interactive Power BI visualizations. It includes KPI cards that highlight average age, cholesterol levels, total patients, and heart disease cases. The dashboard features detailed charts such as age group comparisons, gender-wise analysis, cholesterol risk categories, chest pain type analysis, and a maximum heart rate (Thalach) trend line to identify critical patterns. Interactive slicers for age, sex, chest pain type, and disease status allow users to filter data dynamically, making the dashboard highly intuitive and useful for medical decision-making.

Purpose of the Project:
The purpose of this project is to analyze key medical attributes and patient demographics to identify the factors that contribute most to heart disease. By using Power BI to visualize patterns such as age impact, cholesterol levels, chest pain types, and max heart rate trends, the dashboard helps healthcare professionals quickly detect high-risk patient groups. This project enables better preventive care, supports early diagnosis, and provides data-driven insights that can guide clinical decision-making and awareness about heart disease risks.
